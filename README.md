# Project Overview

In this project we combine experimental biology and modeling to investigate the microbial community response to perturbation, and understand the role Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) plays in the matter. 

This repository will allow all the active members to share and sync files related to the project. 
In this wiki we will document the overall process and aims in the project.

* Kaitlin - I am working on the experimental/lab work aspect of things. Jamie and I are creating a synthetic bacterial community comprised of 6-8 species. We will first test how the sign (+/0/-) and strength of the pairwise interactions between community members may change under different environmental conditions (e.g. increased nutrients, increasing temperature, low levels of an antibiotic, presence of mercury). We will then test how these different environmental conditions affect population dynamics of each species when all species are cultured together as a community. We will perform both experiments over both ecological (1 week) and evolutionary (~40 weeks/300 generations) time scales (In this case what we do is to set up the evolution experiment and get the ecological time scale by simply sampling those populations after one week before transferring them to the next cycle (i.e. moving them to a new culture plate with fresh media)). Next, we will perform the same pairwise and whole-community evolution experiment with an HGT component. We will do two experiments, each time introducing one of two plasmids with different properties (e.g. host ranges, genes conferring resistance to environmental stressors like antibiotics or mercury) into one bacterial strain. We will then check the effect of the plasmid on population dynamics in both the pairwise and whole-community set ups. If possible, we will also track plasmid frequencies within different species in the whole-community set up. Our overarching goal is to understand how environment shapes biotic interactions and factors that influence community robustness in the face of different types of environmental change.
