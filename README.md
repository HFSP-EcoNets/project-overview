# Project Overview

In this project we combine experimental biology and modeling to investigate the microbial community response to perturbation, and understand the role Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) play in the matter. 

This repository will allow all the active members to share and sync files related to the project. 
In this wiki we will document the overall process and aims in the project.


## Aims

### Aim 1
We first aim to develop an overarching theoretical framework. We will construct a modeling framework that considers four main components: \
(1) Plastic variation in the value of a trait \
(2) Evolution \
(3) Mesoscopic structure \
(4) Environmental heterogeneity and perturbations

This will lead to a nonlinear system with analogs in physics of collective behavior. The design of our computational experiments will allow us to compare the relative contribution of different model components to emerging mesoscopic structure and stability.

Here we will ask: \
a. How is community evolution mediated by the environment? \
b. How does variation in evolved structures affect response to perturbations?

### Aim 2
Our second aim will be to investigate the response of bacterial communities to environmental change. This will be done experimantelly using a noval experimental system that grows the communities in conditions that are closer to nature - using sterilized soil media instead of lequid media which allows spatially-structured, nutrient-complex habitats. The experiment will focus on community adaptations rather than on phenotypic plasticity

Here we will ask: \
a. How do pairwise interactions in soil communities vary with environmental change? \
b. How do the evolutionary responses of communities vary with composition and environmental change?


### Aim 3
Lastly We will investigate the multilayer effect of HGT and competition on community response. Specificaly by Plasmids, and how plasmid cost vs benefit interplay between the structure of competition and HGT networks. This will be done theoretically and experimentally, in the context of response to perturbations.
